			<p>I was elected twice for the board of the association taking the roles of Chief
					Financial Officer (2016-2017) and Chief Executive Officer (2017-2018). During this
					time working with the board, I could engage with other Brazilian students and 
					researchers in the United Kingdom. I could also help to shape some of the Abep-UK
					initiatives towards its members. A short list of the activities developed during
					the period is shown below, split in two sections corrresponding to my two roles at

												Island]. The new guide was released at the opening ceremony of the IX Conference 
												Abep-UK that took place at Embassy of Brazil with the presence of the Ambassador 
												of Brazil for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Abep-UK 
												honorary president, HE Eduardo dos Santos and delegates of partner associations, e.g.,

														Brasileira”</i> [<i>Sexual violence and gender diversity: challenges for the Brazilian 
														society</i>], <i>"Hate and Intolerance in Brazil"</i>, and <i>"Anti-corruption fight 
														in Brazil: developments and contradictions"</i>. They took place in Glasgow, Leeds,
